# IT-140_Final
A text based game developed in Python

For our final project we developed a text based game in Python.
This class was a lot of fun and I enjoyed getting the opportunity to learn and write Python.
I created dictionaries to give the player options while in each room as well as a list to hold the items the player had already collected.
I learned a lot making this project and am hoping to add to it in the future.
